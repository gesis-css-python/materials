    "#### Do\n",
    "* Title and label all figures, axes, scales\n",
    "* Include full axis scales\n",
    "* Include indications of error/uncertainty where appropriate\n",
    "* Ensure colours are differentiable (think about colourblindness, B&W print)\n",
    "* Ensure colours are representative of the subject if applicable (where possible)\n",
    "* Maximise \"data-ink ratio\"\n",
    "* Follow norms and conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Don't\n",
    "* Omit data without good reason and communication to viewer\n",
    "* Use extra dimensions like colour, shape if they do not represent anything\n",
    "* Rely on comparisons of area, humans are not good at it\n",
    "* Overcrowd a single plot with data - facets can be useful\n",
    "* Use static 3D figures in a 2D medium\n",
    "* Waste time perfecting your figures before finishing the analysis\n",
    "* Deliberately mislead - often the \"worst\" graphics are produced by those with best understanding of visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Be flexible\n",
    "* Sometimes rules need to be broken e.g.:\n",
    "    - Principles of differentiable / representative colours are sometimes incompatible.\n",
    "    - Starting axes at 0 is not always best, especially if emphasising consequential absolute changes that are small in relative terms (e.g. global temperature changes)\n",
    "    - Understand your audience, ask someone to preview your figure. If they don't understand it, find out why.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- #### Keep learning\n",
    "* Active communities focussed on data visualisation\n",
    "    -\n",
    "    - \n",
    "    - Be wary of \"gurus\" constantly selling courses -->\n",
